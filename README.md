The project entitled as “Intelligent-IMS” is developed as a web application for Inventory Management System. It is used to manage the inventory information about the cars and the stock level using Voice Commands.
The objective of this project is to develop a Voice-Based Car Inventory Management System that integrates with the Google Assistant API and utilizes Firebase as the backend infrastructure.
The system will furnish administrator with an efficient way to manage and track their inventory using voice commands and leverage cloud-based data storage. By integrating with the Google Assistant API, administrator gain the ability to interact with various inventory management functionalities using natural language voice commands.
This system will leverage Google Actions to provide voice-controlled access to inventory information and utilize Firebase as the backend for storing and managing the inventory data. They can add new car entries, update car details, inquire about stock levels, and perform other inventory-related tasks using voice interactions.
The web application uses HTML, CSS, JS, and Firebase as its database, combining front-end design with cloud-based data storage for efficient functionality and user data management.
