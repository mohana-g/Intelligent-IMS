Intelligent-IMS

Description

Intelligent-IMS is a web application designed for Inventory Management System, focusing on managing car inventory and stock levels using voice commands. This innovative system integrates with the Google Assistant API and utilizes Firebase as the backend infrastructure to provide administrators with an efficient way to manage and track their inventory using natural language voice commands.

Existing System

Overview

In the existing system, there might not be an automated system in place for inventory management. Businesses or individuals might be using manual methods, such as spreadsheets or traditional software, to manage their inventory. This manual approach can be time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks integration with voice commands or cloud-based data storage.

Disadvantages of Existing System

Data Maintenance Process is Difficult: Managing and maintaining data manually is complex and prone to errors.

Consuming More Time: Manual processes are time-consuming and inefficient.

Proposed System

Overview

The proposed system offers a streamlined and innovative solution for inventory management, leveraging voice commands and cloud-based data storage to enhance efficiency and user experience. Our system combines Google Actions and Firebase for inventory management. This system will leverage Google Actions to provide voice-controlled access to inventory information and utilize Firebase as the backend for storing and managing the inventory data. It will include the implementation of a Telegram bot integrated with Dialogflow for efficient Inventory Management.

Advantages of Proposed System

Reduced Manual Work: The system automates many tasks, reducing the need for manual data entry and management.

Simple Database Design: The project's database design is straightforward, making it easy for the admin to understand and manage the data flow.
